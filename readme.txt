# simple-text-recognition-python
designed similarly to windows' snipping tool, but for scaning the screen for test.

prerequisites:
you will need to have both files in the same folder and all libraries installed

how to use:
run screen-to-text.py with a scaling number 
eg. $ python3 screen-to-text.py 3

The number:
the 3 tells tells the program to scale up the image to 3 times its original in both dimensions, overall 9 times the pixels
the image to text library does better with scaled up images but takes longer

How I use:
I personally have a shortcut on my taskbar on Ubuntu and run it with 3 as the scaling number, 
this takes around 5 seconds on a mid-tier laptop for scaning a portion of the screen
